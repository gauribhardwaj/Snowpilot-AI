Slide 1: Title
Snowpilot AI (Patent-Pending)
Any Trigger. Any Tool. One Agent.
AI-Powered Change Management for Hybrid Enterprises

Slide 2: Problem Statement
Manual Change Management Drains Productivity and Delays Releases
•	18% of a developer’s week lost to SNOW/Jira paperwork
•	Each ticket takes 20–30 minutes to create and document
•	Up to 12 hours spent waiting for approvals per release
•	6+ fields, 2–3 documents, 4 task states to track per change
•	Developers check SNOW/email 4–5 times daily for updates
•	Result: Slower releases, more errors, less innovation
(Add pie chart: 18% time lost to SNOW)
Slide 3: The Idea
AI Agent Automates Change Management—From PR to SNOW, Instantly
•	Snowpilot AI: An AI-powered agent for end-to-end SNOW automation
•	Listens for PR merges, Jira moves, or build triggers
•	Summarizes, drafts, and files SNOW tickets automatically (LLM-powered)
•	Manages workflows: creation, documentation, approvals, closure
•	Handles edge cases and state transitions, reduces manual steps
•	End Goal: PR merged? SNOW auto-created. Approvals tracked.

How It Works: Agentic Architecture for Change Management

- Listens for PR, Jira, build, or email triggers
- Agentic orchestrator routes each event to “micro-agents”
- LLM summarizer analyzes changes, generates ticket summaries
- Universal adapters bridge REST, SFTP, DB, ServiceNow, Jira, BMC, mainframes
- Auto-fills fields, attaches evidence, creates tasks
- Tracks workflow states, manages exceptions, sends notifications
- Cloud or on-prem deployment (K8s/Docker); all data stays secure
