Slide 1: Title
Snowpilot AI (Patent-Pending)
Any Trigger. Any Tool. One Agent.
AI-Powered Change Management for Hybrid Enterprises

Slide 2: Problem Statement
Manual Change Management Drains Productivity and Delays Releases
•	18% of a developer’s week lost to SNOW/Jira paperwork
•	Each ticket takes 20–30 minutes to create and document
•	Up to 12 hours spent waiting for approvals per release
•	6+ fields, 2–3 documents, 4 task states to track per change
•	Developers check SNOW/email 4–5 times daily for updates
•	Result: Slower releases, more errors, less innovation
(Add pie chart: 18% time lost to SNOW)
Slide 3: The Idea
AI Agent Automates Change Management—From PR to SNOW, Instantly
•	Snowpilot AI: An AI-powered agent for end-to-end SNOW automation
•	Listens for PR merges, Jira moves, or build triggers
•	Summarizes, drafts, and files SNOW tickets automatically (LLM-powered)
•	Manages workflows: creation, documentation, approvals, closure
•	Handles edge cases and state transitions, reduces manual steps
•	End Goal: PR merged? SNOW auto-created. Approvals tracked.
Slide 4: Implementation Plan
Simple, Fast Rollout
•	MVP: Bitbucket → ServiceNow, live in 2 weeks
•	Scale: Add GitHub, Jira, Slack support, error logging (1 month)
•	Enterprise: Air-gapped, app store, on-prem options (3 months)
•	Phased rollout ensures fast feedback and low risk
Slide 5: Tech Involved
Modern, Modular, Resilient
•	LLMs (e.g., GPT/Claude): Summarize and structure tickets
•	Universal adapters: REST, SFTP, DB connectors for legacy support
•	Agentic orchestration (e.g., Agentyx) for workflow automation
•	Cloud or on-premises deployment (Kubernetes/Docker)
Slide 6: Future Scope & Q&A
Scaling to Every Enterprise + Open Q&A
•	Expand to SAP, mainframes, custom stacks
•	Roll out to regulated industries (banking, pharma)
•	Add compliance dashboards, ISV marketplace
•	Ready to automate governance for your stack?
•	(Open floor for questions, share impact chart or anecdote)
