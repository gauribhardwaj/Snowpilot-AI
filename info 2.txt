#### Title:

**WHY SPEND DEVELOPER TIME ON MANAGING SNOW?**

Let AI do the paperwork — you focus on prod. 📈💻⏳

#### Abstract:

Developers are burdened with the repetitive, time-consuming tasks of change management — creating SNOWs, writing descriptions, collecting evidence, and following up for multiple levels of approval. These are all critical for governance, but they shouldn’t be bottlenecks to productivity or resiliency. 🌟🛠️⛔

This is where Snowpilot AI steps in — an AI-powered Change Management Agent that automates and augments the SNOW lifecycle using the power of LLMs. The agent is trained across four key implementation tasks — creation, promotion, documentation, and closure. It learns from historical SNOW tickets and Bitbucket peer review content, enabling it to:

* Auto-create SNOW requests from PR titles and descriptions.
* Attach release evidence and business approval emails.
* Follow up intelligently for tech and production management approvals.
* Provide immediate feedback if a SNOW is rejected — including reason summarization and action steps.

When developers are free from bureaucracy, they write better code, catch more issues, and ship safer releases. This agent is a teammate, not a tool — and it makes change delivery resilient by default. 🛡️👥🔗

#### Problem:

Current manual processes for creating, tracking, and approving SNOW change requests significantly consume developer resources, reduce focus on core tasks, and create workflow bottlenecks. Developers must repeatedly context switch to manually populate request details, attach evidence documents, seek hierarchical approvals (AD, business, and production management), and track multiple tasks (implementation, peer review, testing, validation). This manual overhead not only slows down release cycles but also introduces errors and compliance risks. 🕒🔄⚠️

#### Solution:

Snowpilot AI resolves these challenges by automating the ServiceNow change request process with:

* GitHub/Bitbucket integration for PR monitoring.
* LLM-based PR analysis (ChatGPT/Claude/Gemini) summarizing PRs into SNOW descriptions.
* ServiceNow API integration for automated SNOW creation and task management.
* Automated handling of approval workflows, including AD, Prod Mgmt, and Business approvals.
* Intelligent state transition from "Authorize" to "Implement."

The system continuously monitors release branches, automatically generates comprehensive SNOW requests, and handles peer reviews and hierarchical approvals, including email-based business approvals and AD approval scheduling via calls. It intelligently manages delays and exceptions, enhancing workflow resiliency and reducing manual overhead. 🤖📊🌐

#### High-Level Agent Architecture 📡🧩🤖

* GitHub/Bitbucket Integration (monitors PRs to release branches)
* LLM-Based PR Analysis (ChatGPT/Claude to summarize changes)
* ServiceNow (SNOW) API Integration (auto-creates & manages changes)
* Approval Workflow Automation (handles AD, Prod Mgmt, Business approvals)
* State Transition Logic (moves SNOW from "Authorize" → "Implement")

#### Tech Stack Recommendations 🔧💡📦

| Component          | Tools                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------- |
| PR Monitoring      | GitHub/Bitbucket API, Webhooks                     |
| LLM Integration    | OpenAI API, Anthropic Claude, Gemini               |
| SNOW Automation    | ServiceNow REST API, PySNOW                        |
| Approval Workflows | Email Parsing (Gmail API), Calendly (for AD calls) |
| Orchestration      | Python (FastAPI), Airflow, or AWS Lambda           |
| Deployment         | AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Run, or internal K8s         |

#### Edge Cases Handling 🚨🔀📌

* PR Rejected in Peer Review → Auto-close SNOW or mark as "Failed."
* Business Approval Delayed → Send reminders (via email/Slack).
* Emergency Changes → Allow manual override (skip some approvals).

#### Measured Impact 📊📈📌

| Metric                     | Manual Workflow | With Snowpilot AI | Improvement  |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | ----------------- | ------------ |
| SNOW creation time         | 20–30 mins      | <3 mins           | \~85% faster |
| Approval turnaround        | 6–12 hrs        | 3–5 hrs           | \~40% faster |
| Developer context switches | 3–5/day         | <1/day            | 70% drop     |
| SNOW rejection resolution  | \~2 days        | <1 hr             | 95% faster   |
