## üß† **Patent Submission Summary**

**Title:**
**AI-Driven Change Management Agent for Automated Request Generation and Lifecycle Optimization Across Heterogeneous Toolchains**

**Internal Name:**
**Snowpilot AI Agent**

---

### üö® **Problem**

In modern software development, change management is vital for governance, compliance, traceability, and safe deployment. However, developers today face a burdensome process of:

* Manually creating and filling change requests
* Writing structured descriptions
* Attaching supporting documents
* Managing workflows and task transitions
* Coordinating approvals across multiple stakeholders

These repetitive tasks consume up to **18% of a developer‚Äôs workweek**, lead to frequent context switching, introduce compliance risk, and bottleneck critical deployments ‚Äî particularly in legacy environments where automation is rare or fragile.

Existing automation tools are limited in scope: they typically require pristine pipelines (e.g., 100% code coverage), specific CI/CD setups, or are hardwired to individual platforms like ServiceNow. These tools are inaccessible to teams with older systems or hybrid stacks ‚Äî making automated change management exclusive rather than inclusive.

---

### ‚úÖ **Solution**

**Snowpilot AI** is an **AI-powered, trigger-agnostic, and tool-agnostic change management agent** that automates the end-to-end lifecycle of change requests across modern and legacy platforms.

Trained on historical request data, peer reviews, and system behavior, it uses **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to understand context, generate structured content, and orchestrate workflows across platforms and teams.

---

### üß© **Key Capabilities**

1. **Trigger-Agnostic Event Listening**

   * Works with pull request events, build successes, Jira status transitions, emails, chat commands, or custom webhooks
   * Users can define their own ‚Äútriggers‚Äù via YAML/JSON or UI rules

2. **Context-Aware LLM Summarization**

   * Converts raw input (e.g., code diff, Jira ticket, commit logs) into concise, risk-rated change descriptions
   * Learns from historical changes to improve consistency and style

3. **Universal Change Request Creation**

   * Can create requests in **ServiceNow, Jira CM, BMC Remedy, Freshservice**, or internal systems
   * Automatically fills in fields like owner, dates, risk classification, system impact, and documentation attachments

4. **Workflow & Approval Management**

   * Tracks and updates task states: implementation, peer review, testing, validation
   * Manages hierarchical approvals (Application Developer, Business, Production)
   * Supports escalation, reminders, rejection handling, and call scheduling

5. **State Transition Intelligence**

   * Moves change requests through customizable states:
     e.g., *New ‚Üí Authorize ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Review ‚Üí Close*

6. **Inclusive by Design**

   * Operates on both greenfield and brownfield codebases
   * Works in environments with **partial or no test coverage**
   * Doesn‚Äôt require rewriting existing pipelines

### ‚ö†Ô∏è **Edge Case Handling**

| Scenario                   | Agent Behavior                         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| PR rejected in peer review | Auto-closes or marks SNOW as failed    |
| Business approval delayed  | Sends timed follow-ups via email/chat  |
| Emergency hotfixes         | Allows override path with audit flag   |
| Missing metadata           | Prompts user or pulls from prior cases |

### üìä **Measured Impact: Manual vs. Snowpilot AI Workflow**

| Metric                     | Manual Workflow | Snowpilot AI Workflow | Improvement  |
| -------------------------- | --------------- | --------------------- | ------------ |
| SNOW creation time         | 20‚Äì30 mins      | <3 mins               | \~85% faster |
| Approval turnaround        | 6‚Äì12 hrs        | 3‚Äì5 hrs               | \~40% faster |
| Developer context switches | 3‚Äì5/day         | <1/day                | 70% drop     |
| SNOW rejection resolution  | \~2 days        | <1 hour               | 95% faster   |
| Time saved per PR          | ‚Äî               | \~15+ mins            | Direct gain  |
